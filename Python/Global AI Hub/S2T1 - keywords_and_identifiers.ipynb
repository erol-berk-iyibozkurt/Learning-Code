In the former case, the\n","numbers are converted to a common type and then multiplied together.\n","In the latter case, sequence repetition is performed; a negative\n","repetition factor yields an empty sequence.\n","\n","This operation can be customized using the special \"__mul__()\" and\n","\"__rmul__()\" methods.\n","\n","The \"@\" (at) operator is intended to be used for matrix\n","multiplication.  No builtin Python types implement this operator.\n","\n","New in version 3.5.\n","\n","The \"/\" (division) and \"//\" (floor division) operators yield the\n","quotient of their arguments.  The numeric arguments are first\n","converted to a common type. Division of integers yields a float, while\n","floor division of integers results in an integer; the result is that\n","of mathematical division with the ‘floor’ function applied to the\n","result.  Division by zero raises the \"ZeroDivisionError\" exception.\n","\n","This operation can be customized using the special \"__truediv__()\" and\n","\"__floordiv__()\" methods.\n","\n","The \"%\" (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of\n","the first argument by the second.  The numeric arguments are first\n","converted to a common type.  A zero right argument raises the\n","\"ZeroDivisionError\" exception.  The arguments may be floating point\n","numbers, e.g., \"3.14%0.7\" equals \"0.34\" (since \"3.14\" equals \"4*0.7 +\n","0.34\".)  The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign\n","as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the result is\n","strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand [1].\n","\n","The floor division and modulo operators are connected by the following\n","identity: \"x == (x//y)*y + (x%y)\".  Floor division and modulo are also\n","connected with the built-in function \"divmod()\": \"divmod(x, y) ==\n","(x//y, x%y)\". [2].\n","\n","In addition to performing the modulo operation on numbers, the \"%\"\n","operator is also overloaded by string objects to perform old-style\n","string formatting (also known as interpolation).

The\n","arguments must either both be numbers or both be sequences of the same\n","type.  In the former case, the numbers are converted to a common type\n","and then added together.
